# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System

## Overview
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a web-based application designed to predict the likelihood of several diseases, including heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and gives prediction on each disease. The user-friendly interface is built using the Streamlit module, allowing easy interaction and visualization of the results.

## Features
 Heart Disease Prediction: Analyzes patient data such as age, sex, cp, cholesterol levels, etc., to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
 Parkinson's Disease Prediction: Uses patient data, including voice measurements and motor symptoms, to assess the risk of Parkinson's disease.
 Diabetes Prediction: Evaluates factors like Number of pregnancies,Glucose, Blood Pressure,Skin Thickness,BMI,Diabetes pedigree Function,Age
 Streamlit Interface: A simple and intuitive interface built with Streamlit for ease of use and real-time predictions.

## Models and Datasets
Heart Disease: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
Parkinson's Disease: UCI Parkinson's Disease Dataset
Diabetes: Kaggle
